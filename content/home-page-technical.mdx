## A good site should be:

### Responsive

- Over 50% of people will view your site on a smartphone. You need a design that works well on every screen.

### Search Engine Optimised (SEO)

- A poorly designed site can rank badly in search engines. If they don't see your listing, you lose customers.

### Fast

- As loading time rises from 1 to 3 seconds, the chance your customer quits goes up 32%.

### Accessible

- Make it easy to access, navigate and understand for everyone. People with disabilities are 15% of the population.
