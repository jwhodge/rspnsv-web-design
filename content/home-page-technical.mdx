## Your site should be:

### Responsive

Over 50% of the people who view your site will do it on a smartphone. So you need a design that works well on every screen, from mobile to desktop.

### Search Engine Optimised (SEO)

A poorly designed site may rank badly in search engines. And, if your listing is buried on the third page, you'll lose customers.

### Fast

If your site loading time increases from 1 to 3 seconds, the chance you lose a customer rises 32%. Slow sites also rank lower in search.

### Accessible

You need your site to be easy to access, navigate and understand for every customer. People with disabilities are 15% of the population. It can also affect your search ranking.
