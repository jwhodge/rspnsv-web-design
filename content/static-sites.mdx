## Static Sites

These are fast, simple clear sites where the content doesn't change regularly.

Static sites are optimised to be easily found in a search and load the information quickly.

They are best used to make sure a customer can contact you, and find information about your services and real world location.

- Easy to optimise for search engines
- Easy to maintain
- Single or multi-page
- Can be challenging to update content
- Built in HTML, Gatsby or React
